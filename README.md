# Falsification_decision_control_software

All pre-study material related to the master thesis project 'Falsification of safety critical decision and control software' during spring 2026. Instructions on how to use the different folders below. 

## Prestudy 

This folder contains relevant papers and some other sources to start the prestudy phase of the project. The numbers in the subfolders indicate the recommended order of reading. The mandatory readings are marked in **bold font** below. The expected learning outcome is also outlined. 

### 1_MSc_thesis_Amanda_Andreas

*Learning outcome*: Explain how RL was used to falsify an automated lane change feature and find safety-critical scenarios. Understand the strength and weakness of the RL algorithms used and possible solutions to address the weakness. 

### 2_RL 

*Learning outcome*: Understand and be able to explain the different RL algorithms. Understand the difficulties and practical challenges that arise when you use RL to solve a problem. 

- **RL_Cheat_Sheet**: Mandatory reading.
- intro RL: Assignment from one of the courses at Chalmers.  
- Some other material to read in this part include:
  - **Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn't Work Yet**: Mandatory reading of the blog post https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html
  - John Schulman's talk about the practical tips to consider when doing Deep RL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EcdaCk9KaQ and the slides to his talk http://joschu.net/docs/nuts-and-bolts.pdf
  - Bertsekas video lectures and other material from his course on RL: http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html

### 3_RL_Falsification

*Learning outcome*: Understand how existing research uses RL to falsify and/or test cyber-physical systems. Be able to explain the strengths in each method and highlight the differences to our proposed solution. Get inspiration to solve our problem.  

- **AST_RewardAugmentation_Stanford**: Mandatory reading. You have already read this during your preparation for our interview. 
- **AutomaticTesting_AdversarialAgents_Deshmukh**: Mandatory reading. You are not expected to write theorems and prove them in this project. Therefore you can skip Section IV. The first three sections in this paper and the two case studies in the end are recommended. 
- **Falsification_CPS_DeepRL_Yamagata**: Mandatory reading.
- MasterThesis_AnderssonKara_2021: Master thesis from spring 2021. The project uses RL to falsify a human-robot collaborative workstation. The project investigates different RL algorithms and provides insights. Will be a good reference during the course of your project.
